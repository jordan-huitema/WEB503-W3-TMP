## Challenges

This week has again been quite easy since the class hasnt yet rammped up due to new students needing to catchup. I found the web history class interesting, unfortunatly the thursday lesson was a bit of a let down since we didnt do much and git classroom crashed. A shame but at least we worked around it effectivly
